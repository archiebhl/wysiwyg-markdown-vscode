# Fork Information

Features:
Generally, this fork aims to improve readability and fix some bugs related to code blocks.
- Fixed issues brought about by using Crepe for fenced code, such as buggy typing and erratic caret movements.
- Line wrapping for code blocks. This is not a toggle at the moment.
- Added margins to the UI that mimics Obsidian.md's "Readable Line Lengths" view. No toggle at the moment. 

For devs: 
1. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.
2. Package with `pnpm run package`.
3. Run the code with `F5` to test in the Extension Dev Environment. 
4. To get the VSIX and use the plugin, run `pnpm vscode-package`.
